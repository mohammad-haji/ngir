Conduct\nHelp us keep ngir open and inclusive. Please read and follow our Code of Conduct.\n Got a Question or Problem?\nPlease do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on StackOverflow where the questions should be tagged with tag ngir.\nStackOverflow is a much better place to ask questions since:\n\nthere are thousands of people willing to help on StackOverflow\nquestions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else\nStackOverflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.\n\nTo save your and our time, we will be systematically closing all the issues that are requests for general support and redirecting people to StackOverflow.\n Found an Issue?\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by\nsubmitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Including an issue \nreproduction (via CodePen, JsBin, Plunkr, GitHub repo, etc.) is the absolute best way to help the team quickly\ndiagnose the problem. Screenshots and error stack traces are also helpful.\nPlease follow this simple checklist before submitting:\n\nIf you have a question about using ngir, please ask on the StackOverflow.\n\nIt is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Although we would love to help our users as much as possible, diagnosing issues without clear reproduction steps is extremely time-consuming and simply not sustainable.\n\nThe issue list of this repository is exclusively for bug reports and feature requests. Non-conforming issues will be closed immediately.\n\nIssues with no clear steps to reproduce will not be triaged. If an issue is labeled with \"needs info\" and receives no further replies from the author of the issue for more than 5 days, it will be closed.\n\nIf you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already been reported. You can search through existing issues to see if there is a similar one reported. Include closed issues as it may have been closed with a solution.\n\nNext, create a new issue that thoroughly explains the problem. Please fill out the populated issue form before submitting the issue.\n\n\n Want a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub\nRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with\na proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. \nPlease consider what kind of change it is:\n\nFor a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be\ndiscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,\nand help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.\nSmall Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.\n\n Submitting an Issue\nBefore you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.\nIf your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.\nHelp us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new\nfeatures by not reporting duplicate issues. Please make sure to fill out the populated issue form before submitting the issue.\nYou can file new issues by providing the information here.\n Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch GitHub for an open or closed PR\nthat relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\nRead the developer documentation.\nCreate your patch, including appropriate test cases.\nFollow our Coding Rules.\nTest your changes with our supported browsers and screen readers.\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\ncommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions\nis necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.\n   git commit -aNote: the optional commit -a command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited files.\n\nPush your branch to GitHub:\n  git push my-fork my-fix-branch\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to ngir:master.\n\nIf we suggest changes then:\n\nMake the required updates.\nRe-run npm run release:validate to ensure tests are still passing, linter & build has no errors.\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull\nRequest):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\nAfter your pull request is merged\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository:\n\nDelete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as\n  follows:\n  git push my-fork --delete my-fix-branch\nCheck out the master branch:\n  git checkout master -f\nDelete the local branch:\n  git branch -D my-fix-branch\nUpdate your master with the latest upstream version:\n  git pull --ff upstream master\n\n Coding Rules\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\nAll features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).\nAll public API methods must be documented following JsDoc notation.\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the ngir change log.\nCommit Message Format\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer.  The header has a special\nformat that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): \n\n\n\nThe header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\nRevert\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert:, followed by the header of\nthe reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit ., where the hash is\nthe SHA of the commit being reverted.\nType\nMust be one of the following:\n\nfeat: A new feature\nfix: A bug fix\ndocs: Documentation only changes\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing\nsemi-colons, etc)\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\nperf: A code change that improves performance\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system, CI configuration or external dependencies      (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)\nchore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files\nrelese: Release version commit\n\nScope\nThe scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example\nmenu, sidebar, etc.\nSubject\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\ndon't capitalize first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\nBody\nOptional. Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\".\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.\nFooter\nOptional. The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to\nreference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.\nBreaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines.\nThe rest of the commit message is then used for this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n
